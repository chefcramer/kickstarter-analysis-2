# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This analysis is to determine both the ideal time and ideal funding goal of launching a fundraiser for the play, *Fever*. We will base these conclusions on past trends of success, failure and cancelation, by a number of different criteria.

### Purpose
We will determine the ideal date by month to begin a kickstarter fundraiser by examining the trends by successful plays over the timeframe represented in the data. We will also determine the most ideal and realistic fundraising goal for the project by examining the trends of successful fundraising goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data shows that beginning a kickstarter campaign in May is the most successful overall, with June and July also being very successful. The data shows that May has the most successfully completed fundraisers with 111, June with 100, and July with 87. Conversely, December is shown to be the worst month to start a fundraiser with only 37 successfully completed fundraisers.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The data shows that the ideal goal for the fundraising effort should fall between $0 and $5000. The data shows that plays with a fundraising goal of less than $1000 have a success rate of 76%. With a more realistic understanding of budget, the data shows that the range between $1000 and $5000 still has a success rate of 73% . The data shows a trend that as the goal increases, the chance of failure rises.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were several challenges involved with this analysis. Determining the correct criteria and values to be displayed on charts. Correctly separating the data into specific categories and subcategories, as well as filtering that data into usable and readable formats was challenging.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The best time to launch a kickstarter is in the early summer, May, June, and July. The number of successful campaigns being 111, 100, and 87 respectively. 
2. While the worst time to launch a kickstarter is in December (all that holiday shopping...). With the successful fundraising campaigns being only 37.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The smaller the fundraising goal the more likely it is to succeed. The data shows that you can get lucky with larger goals, but by far the best bet is to stay small.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This dataset is limited in that we are unsure of the origine of this data, so it is hard to confirm the information. Also, the data also only exists up until 2017, so it is impoissible to say what the current conclusions could be.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1. Another chart that might be useful would be; determining the success or failure as well as the fundraising goal country to country could be very helpful. From my examinition, it doesnt seem to make that big of a difference.
2. Another chart that could be useful would be comparing the number of backers to successful campaigns in the $1000 to $5000 range. This would show how much advertising or networking you might need to do in order to get funded.
